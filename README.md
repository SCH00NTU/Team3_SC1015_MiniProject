SC1015 MiniProject SC1015 Data Science 

About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which uses the Video Game with Rating Dataset.

Problem Statement: 
How can we predict the Global Sales of Video Games based on its Year_of_Release, Genre, Publisher and Platform? How can we do so?

Models Used:
Gradient Boosting Machine
Random Forest Regressor

Conclusion:
Accuracy may be an issue due to old games phasing out
Could help Publishers decide what games to put out in the future
With the wide variety of games out there, there may be factors that we have yet to consider in order to paint a better picture on the deciding factor that will contribute to the sales of video games

What we learnt:
Handling null values and skew
Using Categorical and Numerical data to predict Numerical data 
Random Forest Regressor from Scikit-learn
Gradient Boosting Machine using XGBoost library
