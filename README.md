# Global Game Sales: Forecasting the Future

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which uses the Video Game with Rating Dataset.

## Contributors
- Shun Yu: Gradient Boosting Machine
- Cherilyn: Exploratory Data Analysis, Random Forest Regressor
- Athena: Random Forest Regressor

## Problem Statement
How can we predict the Global Sales of Video Games based on its Year_of_Release, Genre, Publisher, and Platform? How can we do so?

## Models Used
- Gradient Boosting Machine
- Random Forest Regressor

## Conclusion
- Accuracy may be an issue due to old games phasing out.
- Could help Publishers decide what games to put out in the future.
- With the wide variety of games out there, there may be factors that we have yet to consider in order to paint a better picture on the deciding factor that will contribute to the sales of video games.

## What we learned
- Handling null values and skew.
- Using Categorical and Numerical data to predict Numerical data.
- Random Forest Regressor from Scikit-learn.
- Gradient Boosting Machine using XGBoost library.
